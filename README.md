This application is a **Pokédex** that allows you to find all the Pokémons. You can explore a complete list of Pokémons and access their cards detailing their main characteristics. It is possible to navigate between cards by swiping or by pressing a button, and you can listen to the Pokémon's cry by clicking on its icon.
